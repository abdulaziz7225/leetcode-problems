Problem Number: 202. Happy Number
Difficulty Level: Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number

********************************************************************************

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
  
Example 1:
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: false
  
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

            unique_nums.add(n)

            output = 0

                output += r**2
            n = output

            if n == 1:
                return True

        return False

# k is the number of unique numbers encountered and stored in the set before a cycle is detected or the number 1 is found
# Since O(k) is a small constant, the time complexity can be simplified from O(k * log(n)) to O(log(n)).
# Time Complexity: O(k * log(n)) --> O(log(n))
# Space Complexity: O(k)
