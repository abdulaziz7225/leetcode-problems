Problem Number: 344. Reverse String
Difficulty Level: Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string

********************************************************************************

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
  
Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
  
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s[i] is a printable ascii character.
