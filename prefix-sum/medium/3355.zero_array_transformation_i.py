Problem Number: 3355. Zero Array Transformation I
Difficulty Level: Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/zero-array-transformation-i

********************************************************************************

You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [li, ri].
For each queries[i]:
Select a subset of indices within the range [li, ri] in nums.
Decrement the values at the selected indices by 1.
A Zero Array is an array where all elements are equal to 0.
Return true if it is possible to transform nums into a Zero Array after processing all
the queries sequentially, otherwise return false.
  
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,0,1], queries = [[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation:
For i = 0:
Select the subset of indices as [0, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
The array will become [0, 0, 0], which is a Zero Array.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,3,2,1], queries = [[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation:
For i = 0:
Select the subset of indices as [1, 2, 3] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
The array will become [4, 2, 1, 0].
For i = 1:
Select the subset of indices as [0, 1, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
The array will become [3, 1, 0, 0], which is not a Zero Array.
  
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
queries[i].length == 2
0 <= li <= ri < nums.length
