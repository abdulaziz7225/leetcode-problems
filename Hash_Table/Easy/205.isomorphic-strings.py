Problem Number: 205. Isomorphic Strings
Difficulty Level: Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings

********************************************************************************

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
  
Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Explanation:
The strings s and t can be made identical by:
Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.

Example 2:
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Explanation:
The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

Example 3:
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
  
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
t.length == s.length
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.

# Space Complexity: O(128) for ASCII characters ==> O(1)
