Problem Number: 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer
Difficulty Level: Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer

********************************************************************************

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.
Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.
  
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

Example 2:
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
  
Constraints:
The Linked List is not empty.
Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
Each node's value is either 0 or 1.
