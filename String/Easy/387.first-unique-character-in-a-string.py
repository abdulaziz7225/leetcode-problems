Problem Number: 387. First Unique Character in a String
Difficulty Level: Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string

********************************************************************************

Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.
  
Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Explanation:
The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.

Example 2:
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
  
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
