********************************************************************************

The power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.
Given a string s, return the power of s.
  
Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
