Problem Number: 189. Rotate Array
Difficulty Level: Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array

********************************************************************************

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
  
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
  
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
0 <= k <= 105
  Follow up:
Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
