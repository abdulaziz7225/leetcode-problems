Problem Number: 3151. Special Array I
Difficulty Level: Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-i

********************************************************************************

An array is considered special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.
You are given an array of integers nums. Return true if nums is a special array, otherwise, return false.
  
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: true
Explanation:
There is only one element. So the answer is true.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation:
There is only two pairs: (2,1) and (1,4), and both of them contain numbers with different parity. So the answer is true.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [4,3,1,6]
Output: false
Explanation:
nums[1] and nums[2] are both odd. So the answer is false.
  
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
