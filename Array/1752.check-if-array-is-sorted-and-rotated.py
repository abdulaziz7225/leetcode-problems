Problem Number: 1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated
Difficulty Level: Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-is-sorted-and-rotated

********************************************************************************

Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.
There may be duplicates in the original array.
Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length], where % is the modulo operation.
  
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.
  
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
